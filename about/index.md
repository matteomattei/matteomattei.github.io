Resume summary:
---------------
I believe in Open Source software and Linux. I currently work as platform lead for a US multinational company, leader in fuel dispensers and outdoor payment systems. I also work as a freelance computer engineer for various companies as Linux system administrator and web developer.

I am always ready to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I've not problem to move outside my country and I am willing to relocate wherever there is a good opportunity of professional growth.

I am used to work in small, medium and big companies and I have no problem working under pressure in mission critical projects.
